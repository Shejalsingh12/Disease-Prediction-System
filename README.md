# Disease-Prediction-System
Develop a machine learning application capable of predicting diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's, and heart disease. The system leverages advanced algorithms like Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Logistic Regression to process patient data and generate reliable predictions.

Key Contributions:
1. Machine Learning Model Development:
Led the creation of predictive models focused on early disease detection.
Designed and implemented algorithms like SVC and Logistic Regression to analyze complex datasets and produce actionable results.

2. Data Handling and Model Optimization:
Employed advanced preprocessing and feature engineering methods to enhance data quality and model accuracy.
Conducted thorough model evaluation and validation to ensure robust predictions.

3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration:
Partnered with healthcare experts to ensure the predictions aligned with clinical priorities.
Focused on making the model outcomes both practically relevant and scientifically sound.
